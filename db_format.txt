# Design Principles

Window #1: Request the user to select only the columns they wish to filter the results by
Windows #2-x: Request the user to further specify the details of the filters they chose in Window #1
--> Background processing of user selected filters and data to be filtered for each to create SQLlite query -->
Results Window: Ask the user to confirm the results to be mapped --> Create the map.html file using the results

# TODO: Issues / Bugs
# Issues Found:
1.) |_| If filters are left empty, the application still proceeds to the query building phase. In fact, the program will
    always proceed if the filter contents are anything other than the default text string
2.) |X| Application crashes if user enters either of the address or distance filter, but not both
3.) |_| Fails on the user pressing 'Submit' by way of returning way too many results. Query will take a very long time
4.) |_| Add try / catch exception for the connection to pygeo for timeout errors so that it tries again at least once after 10 seconds.
5.) |X| Query fails for date/time because format wrong in sqlite db
7.) |X| Limit start and end dates to dateset for dataset
8.) |X| If the user does not select Longitude / Latitude in the listbox, it is not included in the query which breaks the whole application
        --> Resolution: Forced the application to append the lat / long to the listbox results returned
9.) |X| Formatting incorrect on SQL statement created; creates two "FROM" items and two "WHERE" items without spaces in between
10.) |X| Formatting on .bindPopup leaflet javascript function requires a string format but within another string
        --> Resolution: used escape "\" character to allow for addition of double quotes to string
11.) |X| The format of the datetime string returned from each of the startdate and enddate objects are not in the correct format
12.) |_| All of the above option does not work. Logically can remove it and if they don't filter it by that it selects all
13.) |X| Two different icons are necessary as it is not possible to see the home address and the other plotted points


# TODO: Items that would be useful
1.) |_| Loading bar / Progress bar
2.) |_| Auto-Launch Default web browser to open report.html
        A.) Get current OS
        B.) Based on current OS, get current default web browser / executable location
        C.) Open the report.html that was just created in the default web browser
            i.) When the user presses the 'Submit' button, check to see if report.html is already open. If it is, refresh it. If not, execute step C.
